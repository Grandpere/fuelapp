# TODO - SP4-002 Back-office API for stations and vehicles

## Plan
- [completed] Add admin API CRUD for stations under `/api/admin/stations`.
- [completed] Add vehicle context + persistence + migration + admin API CRUD under `/api/admin/vehicles`.
- [completed] Add basic filtering/search (`q`, `city`, `geocodingStatus`) for back-office lists.
- [completed] Keep ownership boundaries explicit: admin-only prefixes, no impact on user-scoped APIs.
- [completed] Add functional/integration coverage for admin separation and vehicle persistence.
- [completed] Run quality checks.
